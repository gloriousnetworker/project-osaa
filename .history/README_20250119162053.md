Project OSAA - Frontend

Welcome to Project OSAA! This is the frontend application for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to mint tokens, transfer tokens, and check their balances. The app is integrated with MetaMask for wallet connection and uses React for the frontend.

Live Application
You can access the live version of the application here:https://project-osaa.vercel.app/
Project OSAA - Live Demo

GitHub Repository
The source code for the frontend application is available on GitHub:
Project OSAA - GitHub Repository

Features
Mint Tokens: Mint your own tokens on the blockchain.
Transfer Tokens: Send tokens to other users' addresses.
Balance Check: View your token balance in real-time.
MetaMask Integration: Connect with MetaMask to interact with the blockchain.
Prerequisites
To run the project locally, you need to have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
You can download it from Node.js Official Website
MetaMask browser extension
You can install it from MetaMask Official Website
Installation & Setup Guide
Follow these steps to clone and set up the application on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/gloriousnetworker/project-osaa.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd project-osaa
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies for the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This will install all necessary dependencies, including React, ethers.js, and other packages used in the application.

4. Set Up Environment Variables
Make sure your environment is set up correctly for the app to interact with MetaMask and the smart contract. This may require adding environment variables, such as your Ethereum network or contract address, depending on your specific configuration.

For local development:

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project (if not already present) and add the following:

env
Copy
Edit
REACT_APP_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your-infura-project-id
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your-smart-contract-address
Replace the placeholders with your own values for the Infura project ID and smart contract address (use testnet addresses if you're testing on a testnet).

5. Start the Development Server
Once dependencies are installed and the environment variables are set, start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will run the app locally on http://localhost:5173/. You can access the app by opening the URL in your browser.

6. Connect to MetaMask
To interact with the Ethereum blockchain, you need to have the MetaMask extension installed in your browser. Once installed, connect your MetaMask wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button on the homepage. If you have a test wallet set up on a test network like Goerli, you can use that to interact with the smart contract.

How to Modify the Application
To make changes to the application, follow these steps:

1. Modify the UI
The main UI components are located in the /src folder.
The homepage layout and components are in src/pages/Home.jsx.
You can add or modify components by creating new files in the /src/components folder.
Update the app's styling by modifying src/index.css or creating new CSS files for specific components.
2. Interact with the Smart Contract
The smart contract interaction logic is handled using ethers.js. To modify how the app interacts with the blockchain:

Open the src/pages/Home.jsx file.
The main logic for interacting with the Ethereum network, such as minting tokens and transferring them, is handled by the ethers library in the connectWallet and copyToClipboard functions.
To call other smart contract methods:

Import the smart contract ABI (Application Binary Interface).
Use ethers.Contract to create a contract instance and interact with it.
Example for interacting with a smart contract method:

jsx
Copy
Edit
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, provider);

const mintToken = async (toAddress, amount) => {
  const transaction = await contract.mint(toAddress, amount);
  await transaction.wait();
  console.log('Tokens minted successfully');
};
3. Update Wallet Integration
If you want to modify the wallet connection logic, you can update the connectWallet function in Home.jsx. This function is responsible for connecting MetaMask to the app.

To connect to another wallet provider, modify the window.ethereum logic or add additional wallet support (like WalletConnect).

Deployment Instructions
Once you've made modifications or are ready to deploy the app, follow these steps:

1. Deploy to Vercel
If you want to deploy your app to Vercel, follow these steps:

Create a Vercel account at Vercel.
Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
Vercel will automatically detect that it's a React app and provide deployment options.
Once the app is deployed, you'll receive a live URL (similar to the one provided above).
2. Deployment on Netlify
Alternatively, you can deploy on Netlify:

Create a Netlify account at Netlify.
Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
Configure build settings for the React app.
Deploy the app to get a live URL.
Testing
To test the frontend components:

Unit Testing: Use Jest or React Testing Library to write tests for your components.
MetaMask Integration: Test the MetaMask wallet connection flow by manually interacting with the app.
For smart contract testing, refer to the backend README or documentation for instructions on testing the smart contract functions using tools like Hardhat or Truffle.

Troubleshooting
MetaMask not working: Ensure that MetaMask is installed and the network is set to a testnet like Goerli or Sepolia.
App not connecting to MetaMask: Refresh the page or check for any issues in the browser's developer console.
